Introduced native local file management, allowing users to own their data completely by editing local Markdown files directly.

### ✨ Features
- **Local File Access**: Integrated Web File System Access API for direct reading and writing of local `.md` files.
- **Auto-Save System**:
  - Implemented smart auto-save with debounce (saves 2s after last edit) to minimize disk I/O.
  - Added visual "SAVING..." indicator.
- **External Change Detection**: Real-time monitoring of the file on disk, prompting the user to reload if changes are detected externally.
- **Default File Setup**: Capability to pin a file as default for auto-loading on startup (permission persistence handled).
- **UI Enhancements**: Consolidated file operations (Open, Save, Set Default) into a compact icon toolbar in the sidebar.
